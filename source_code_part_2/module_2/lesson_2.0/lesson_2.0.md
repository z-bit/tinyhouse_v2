# Module 2 Introduction

The boilerplate of our application is now prepared. In this module, we'll begin establishing the main page-level components of our application as well as the different URL routes for where these components should show.

For the details within this module:

-   We'll address what routing is within the context of a web application.
-   Spend a little time addressing the difference between server-side and client-side routing.
-   Install and introduce React Router in our client application.
-   Finally, set-up some of the main routes and corresponding components we'll have in TinyHouse.
