# Module 17 Introduction

I> This is the first bonus module we've prepared and introduced after our course has been released! This module (and the following modules) are not core material to the TinyHouse Masterclass but instead serve to be small spin-off modules that teach and introduce a topic that wasn't covered in the course!

Throughout the course, weâ€™ve used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as our database of choice. As we've mentioned earlier in the course - NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, use a dynamic schema for unstructured or polymorphic data. This offers developers great flexibility when building apps that need to _evolve constantly_.

**SQL databases**, on the other hand, require us to use a **defined schema for structured data**. This offers developers consistency at the expense of flexibility. Therefore, if you value structure more than flexibility, you might just prefer a SQL database over a NoSQL database.

In this module, we're going to:

- Compare SQL and NoSQL databases using some live data.
- Install [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and learn some basic SQL.
- Convert our apps to use PostgreSQL as our database.
