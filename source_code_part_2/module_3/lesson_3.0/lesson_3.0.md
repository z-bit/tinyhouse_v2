# Module 3 Introduction

In Part I of the course, we introduced [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as a non-relational database that doesn't require to have a schema associated with it. However, with the help of TypeScript, we can type define the shape of the data we insert and receive from a MongoDB database.

We'll spend some time constructing the shape of documents we intend to store for the different collections we'll establish in Part II of the course. In Part II, we'll work with three collections:

-   **`"users"`** collection to store user data.
-   **`"listings"`** collection to store listing data.
-   **`"bookings"`** collection to store booking data.

In this module, we'll work on the server project and:

-   Declare the three collections we intend to create.
-   With TypeScript, describe the shape of documents we intend to store for each collection.
-   Seed the collections in our database with mock data that we've prepared and will provide to you.
