# Module 15 Introduction

At this point, we've finished everything we set out to do to build and deploy the TinyHouse application! In this module, we've prepared a few separate lessons on topics we consider good to know and/or important that don't really fall into the grand scheme of the actual TinyHouse application. For this module, you won't have to proceed through every lesson in order and you're welcome to move around from one lesson to another.

We'll be updating this module as time goes by but at this moment we'll discuss:

- Building the UI of the **Not Found** page of our client.
- **ApolloClient** & **FetchPolicy**.
- The **useLayoutEffect** Hook & Window Scroll.
- **React Router Hooks**.
- Stripe Disconnect & **Revoking Access**.
- Additional Listing DatePicker Changes.
