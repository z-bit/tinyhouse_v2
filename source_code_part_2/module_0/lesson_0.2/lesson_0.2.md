# The TinyHouse App

Welcome to Newline's first Masterclass - **TinyHouse**.

TinyHouse is a structured, self-paced, online learning course designed to help you build a Universal JavaScript application. We'll be working with a variety of different technologies such as **React**, **GraphQL**, and **TypeScript** to learn how we can build a real home-sharing app including authentication, data persistence, payments, and deployment.

In this document, we'll be highlighting the [TinyHouse](http://tinyhouse.app/) application we are to build in this course. By the end of Part II, we'll have a fully functioning home-sharing application where users will be able to sign-in, create a listing, and book other listings.
