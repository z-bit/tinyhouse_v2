In **Part II**, we take everything weâ€™ve learned from Part I and focus our efforts on building the TinyHouse home sharing application.

In more detail, for Part II of the course we'll:

1.  Prepare the boilerplate of our app from the code we've built in Part I
2.  Use **React Router** to create the necessary client-side routes of our app.
3.  Establish the structure of the documents and collections in our database.
4.  Allow user authentication with **Google Sign-In and OAuth 2.0**
5.  See how can persist login sessions for users with the help of **cookies**
6.  Query and display user information in the User page of our app.
7.  Query listing information and have it displayed in the Listing page of our app.
8.  Query information for multiple listings.
9.  Allow users to search for listings in certain locations with the help of **Google's Geocoding API**.
10. Use the third-party payment provider **Stripe** to allow users to pay out other users in our app.
11. Allow users to host a listing.
12. Host our listing images using **Cloudinary**.
13. Allow users to book a listing from other users.
14. Compile & deploy our TinyHouse application to the cloud with the help of **Heroku**.
15. Finally, the last module will be a **bonus module** that consists of individual lessons that teach certain specific topics we consider important and weren't able to cover during the core of the course.

There's a lot of content here and we're incredibly excited to have you on board!
