# Module 10 Introduction

[**Stripe**](https://stripe.com/) is a third-party payment processor that helps applications and businesses accept payments online in a safe/secure manner. In TinyHouse, we're going to use Stripe to help handle payments between tenants and hosts.

In this module, we'll

-   Discuss [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) and the [Stripe Connect](https://stripe.com/connect) product for marketplaces
-   Discuss how we'll facilitate Sign-in with Stripe, with OAuth 2.0, so users that are to receive payments can sign-in with their Stripe accounts.
-   Establish the GraphQL Fields for Stripe authentication.
-   Interact with the Stripe API and build the accompanying resolver functions.
-   Update the user profile section of a logged-in user in the User page, to allow a user to connect and disconnect with Stripe from our application.
