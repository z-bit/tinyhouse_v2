# Module 9 Introduction

**Geocoding** is the process of converting address information, in the form of text, into specific geographic coordinates. We're going to leverage the capability to geocode address information to help allow users to search for listings in certain locations. We'll do this with the help of [Google's Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start).

In this module, we'll

-   Discuss how Google's Geocoding API works as well as retrieve the necessary API keys for application.
-   Interact with the Geocoding API in our server to resolve the address/location inputs provided by a user.
-   In the client, navigate a user to the Listings page when a location search is made.
-   In the Listings page, query for listings in a specific location with the help of the Geocoding API.
-   Finally, create an index for our `"listings"` collection to support efficient location-based queries.
