# Module 18 Introduction

I> This is the second bonus module we've prepared and introduced after our course has been released! This module (and the following modules) are not core material to the TinyHouse Masterclass but instead serve to be small spin-off modules that teach and introduce a topic that wasn't covered in the course!

As we've built the TinyHouse application, one aspect of web development we haven't paid attention to as of yet is **unit testing**. Unit testing is a confined approach that involves isolating each part of an application and testing it in isolation. Tests are provided a given input and an output is often evaluated to make sure it matches expectations.

In this module, we'll explain and introduce unit testing on our client application. In particular, we'll:

- Introduce the concept of unit testing.
- Introduce [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) & [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro).
- Highlight the [Apollo React Testing](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-testing/) utility.
- Prepare tests for the client **Home** component.
- Prepare tests for the client **Login** component.
- Discuss the role of pull requests to pushing code to a protected branch.
