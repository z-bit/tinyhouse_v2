# Module 14 Introduction

For the last core module of Part II of the course, we'll investigate how we can deploy our application!

In this module, we'll:

-   Briefly talk about cloud computing and the difference between **Platform as a service**, **Infrastructure as a service**, and **Software as a service**.
-   Leverage [**Heroku**](https://www.heroku.com/) to have our application deployed!
