# Building the App Header & Logout

> üìù The `tinyhouse-logo.png` image asset used in this lesson can be found - [here](./public/assets/tinyhouse-logo.png).

We've been able to go through Google's Sign-In flow and obtain the details of a signed-in viewer in our client app. In this lesson, we'll look to find a way to notify the viewer whenever they're in the logged-in state. We'll achieve this by creating an app header element that indicates when a viewer is logged in and will also allow the viewer to navigate between different routes in the app.

### `<AppHeader />`

We'll create an `<AppHeader />` component that'll be shown in all different pages and will allow the user to navigate around the app, log in, and log out.

![](public/assets/app-header.jpg)

We'll have this `<AppHeader />` component be established within a new `src/sections/` folder.

```shell
client/
  // ...
  src/
    // ...
    sections/
      AppHeader
        index.tsx
      // ...
    // ...
  // ...
```

> **Note:** We use an image asset labeled `tinyhouse-logo.png` in the `src/sections/AppHeader/assets/` folder for the app header. Find a source for this image asset - [here](./public/assets/tinyhouse-logo.png).

The `<AppHeader />` component will use the `<Header />` component from Ant Design's [`<Layout />`](https://ant.design/components/layout/) component. We'll first look to have the `<AppHeader />` component display the application logo. In the `src/sections/AppHeader/index.tsx` file, we'll import the `React` library, the `<Layout />` component from Ant Design, and the `tinyhouse-logo` asset. We'll also import the `<Link />` component from `react-router-dom` that we'll use to allow the user to click the logo in the app header and navigate back to the index route (i.e. `/`).

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { Layout } from "antd";

import logo from "./assets/tinyhouse-logo.png";
```

We'll destruct the `<Header />` component from `<Layout />`. We'll construct the `<AppHeader />` component and have it return a header with the `tinyhouse-logo` image kept in a `<Link />` component that acts as a link to the index route (`/`).

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { Layout } from "antd";

import logo from "./assets/tinyhouse-logo.png";

const { Header } = Layout;

export const AppHeader = () => {
  return (
    <Header className="app-header">
      <div className="app-header__logo-search-section">
        <div className="app-header__logo">
          <Link to="/">
            <img src={logo} alt="App logo" />
          </Link>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Header>
  );
};
```

In the `src/sections/index.ts` file, we'll have the `<AppHeader />` component function be re-exported.

```ts
export * from "./AppHeader";
```

In the parent `src/index.tsx` file, we'll import the `<AppHeader />` component and look to place it at the top of our `<App />` component return statement. To have the `<AppHeader />` component shown in every route, we'll place it outside of the router `<Switch />` statement. To ensure the `<AppHeader />` component stays affixed to the top of the page even if we were to scroll down, we'll import and use the [`<Affix />`](https://ant.design/components/affix/) component from Ant design and wrap our `AppHeader` component with it. By specifying the `offsetTop` option to `0` for the `<Affix />` component, we're stating that we want the child elements within it to stay at the very top of the page.

```tsx
// ...
import { Affix } from "antd";
// ...

const App = () => {
  // ...
  return (
    <Router>
      <Affix offsetTop={0} className="app__affix-header">
        <AppHeader />
      </Affix>
      <Switch>{/* ... */}</Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};
```

When we launch our client application, we'll now be presented with the `<AppHeader />` component that shows our application logo regardless of what route we're in.

![](public/assets/app-header-just-logo.png)

### `<MenuItems />`

We'll leverage the [`<Menu />` component](https://ant.design/components/menu/) from Ant Design to help show a menu of links that the user can use in the `<AppHeader />`. When the viewer is _not_ signed-in, we'll want to show a link to the `/host` page and a "Sign In" button to take them to the `/login` page.

![](public/assets/app-header-logged-off.png)

However, when the user is signed in - instead of the "Sign In" button, we're interested in showing the avatar of the viewer that itself is a drop-down button that will allow the viewer to navigate to their profile (i.e. user page) or log out of the application.

![](public/assets/app-header-logged-in.png)

The menu items section of the app header will have some decent functionality of its own so we'll abstract that section away to a new component we'll call `<MenuItems />` that will be set up in the `components/` folder of `AppHeader/`.

We'll also have an `index.ts` file be kept in the `src/sections/AppHeader/components/` folder.

```shell
client/
  // ...
  src/
    // ...
    AppHeader/
      components/
        MenuItems/
          index.tsx
        index.ts
    // ...
  // ...
```

In the `MenuItems/index.tsx` file, we'll first aim to have the menu items show the `"Host"` link and the `"Sign In"` button. We'll import and use the `<Button />`, `<Icon />`, and `<Menu />` components from Ant Design to help us here. We'll destruct the child `<Item />` and `<SubMenu />` components from Ant Design that we'll use. We'll use the `<Link />` component from React Router to have the "Host" menu item be navigable to the `/host` route and the "Sign In" button be navigable to the `/login` route.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { Button, Icon, Menu } from "antd";

const { Item, SubMenu } = Menu;

export const MenuItems = () => {
  return (
    <Menu mode="horizontal" selectable={false} className="menu">
      <Item key="/host">
        <Link to="/host">
          <Icon type="home" />
          Host
        </Link>
      </Item>
      <Item key="/login">
        <Link to="/login">
          <Button type="primary">Sign In</Button>
        </Link>
      </Item>
    </Menu>
  );
};
```

In the `src/sections/AppHeader/components/index.ts` file, we'll re-export the `<MenuItems />` component function.

```ts
export * from "./MenuItems";
```

We'll import the `<MenuItems />` component in the `<AppHeader />` component and render it as a child component.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { Layout } from "antd";

import logo from "./assets/tinyhouse-logo.png";

const { Header } = Layout;

export const AppHeader = () => {
  return (
    <Header className="app-header">
      <div className="app-header__logo-search-section">
        <div className="app-header__logo">
          <Link to="/">
            <img src={logo} alt="App logo" />
          </Link>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="app-header__menu-section">
        <MenuItems viewer={viewer} setViewer={setViewer} />
      </div>
    </Header>
  );
};
```

If we launch our client application in the browser, we'll be presented with the `"Host"` link and `"Sign In"` button.

![](public/assets/app-header-logged-off.png)

If we were to click the `"Host"` link or `"Sign In"` button, we'll be taken to the `/host` page and `/login` page respectively.

We'll now want to conditionally show the viewer avatar in the `<MenuItems />` element **if the user is logged in**. To do so, we'll need access to the `viewer` state value in our parent `<App />` component. In the `<App />` component, we'll pass the `viewer` state value as a prop down to the rendered `<AppHeader />` component.

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const [viewer, setViewer] = useState<Viewer>(initialViewer);

  return (
    <Router>
      <Affix offsetTop={0} className="app__affix-header">
        <AppHeader viewer={viewer} />
      </Affix>
      <Switch>{/* ... */}</Switch>
    </Router>
  );
};
```

In the `<AppHeader />` component we'll declare the `viewer` prop and pass it along down to the `<MenuItems />` component. We'll import the `Viewer` interface from the `lib/types.ts` file and set it as the type of the `viewer` prop.

```tsx
// ...
import { Viewer } from "../../lib/types";
// ...

interface Props {
  viewer: Viewer;
}

export const AppHeader = ({ viewer }: Props) => {
  return (
    <Header className="app-header">
      <div className="app-header__logo-search-section">
        <div className="app-header__logo">
          <Link to="/">
            <img src={logo} alt="App logo" />
          </Link>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="app-header__menu-section">
        <MenuItems viewer={viewer} />
      </div>
    </Header>
  );
};
```

With the `viewer` prop available in `<MenuItems />`, we can conditionally render the viewer avatar and drop-down menu when the viewer is signed in. The drop-down menu will be created with the help of the `<SubMenu />` child component Ant Design provides.

Within the `<MenuItems />` component, we'll create a `const` element called `subMenuLogin` which will be a `<SubMenu />` component. This `subMenuLogin` element will have a "Profile" menu item to be used as a link to the user page and a `"Log out"` menu item which will be used as a trigger to help log out the user.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Button, Icon, Menu } from "antd";

const { Item, SubMenu } = Menu;

export const MenuItems = () => {
  const subMenuLogin = (
    <SubMenu>
      <Item key={"/user/"}>
        <Icon type="user" />
        Profile
      </Item>
      <Item key="logout">
        <Icon type="logout" />
        Log out
      </Item>
    </SubMenu>
  );

  return (
    // ...
  );
};
```

We'll conditionally have the `subMenuLogin` element display the submenu item if the `viewer` is logged in. To do so, we can check for a valid property of the `viewer` object. For example, if the `id` of the `viewer` exists, it most likely means the server was able to return a `viewer` instance. If the `viewer` doesn't exist, we'll have the `subMenuLogin` element display the `"Sign In"` button. We'll render the `subMenuLogIn` `const` element in the return statement of the `<MenuItems />` component.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { Button, Icon, Menu } from "antd";
import { Viewer } from "../../../../lib/types";

interface Props {
  viewer: Viewer;
}

const { Item, SubMenu } = Menu;

export const MenuItems = ({ viewer }: Props) => {
  const subMenuLogin = viewer.id ? (
    <SubMenu>
      <Item key="/user">
        <Icon type="user" />
        Profile
      </Item>
      <Item key="/logout">
        <Icon type="logout" />
        Log out
      </Item>
    </SubMenu>
  ) : (
    <Item>
      <Link to="/login">
        <Button type="primary">Sign In</Button>
      </Link>
    </Item>
  );

  return (
    <Menu mode="horizontal" selectable={false} className="menu">
      <Item key="/host">
        <Link to="/host">
          <Icon type="home" />
          Host
        </Link>
      </Item>
      {subMenuLogin}
    </Menu>
  );
};
```

The `<SubMenu />` component takes a `title` prop with which we'll be able to use to show the avatar of the logged-in user. We'll import an `<Avatar />` component from Ant Design and place it in the `title` prop and use the `avatar` property within the `viewer` object as the source.

To ensure the viewer avatar is to be shown only when the `viewer.avatar` property exists, we'll state that both the `viewer.id` and `viewer.avatar` fields should exist (i.e. not be `null`) to render the `<SubMenu />` element.

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { Avatar, Button, Icon, Menu } from "antd";
import { Viewer } from "../../../../lib/types";

interface Props {
  viewer: Viewer;
}

const { Item, SubMenu } = Menu;

export const MenuItems = ({ viewer }: Props) => {
  const subMenuLogin =
    viewer.id && viewer.avatar ? (
      <SubMenu title={<Avatar src={viewer.avatar} />}>
        <Item key="/user">
          <Icon type="user" />
          Profile
        </Item>
        <Item key="/logout">
          <Icon type="logout" />
          Log out
        </Item>
      </SubMenu>
    ) : (
      <Item>
        <Link to="/login">
          <Button type="primary">Sign In</Button>
        </Link>
      </Item>
    );

  return (
    <Menu mode="horizontal" selectable={false} className="menu">
      <Item key="/host">
        <Link to="/host">
          <Icon type="home" />
          Host
        </Link>
      </Item>
      {subMenuLogin}
    </Menu>
  );
};
```

In our UI, let's attempt to login and go through the consent flow. When being taken back to our app, we'll notice after a brief period - we're now presented with our avatar image and a drop-down menu! Amazing!

![](public/assets/app-header-logged-in.png)

### `logOut`

We'll now wire the `logOut` mutation with the `"Log out"` button in our `<AppHeader />` menu items.

> If we recall, the `logOut` mutation resolver function doesn't achieve much at this moment. It simply returns an empty `viewer` object which is something we can do on the client. In the next module, `logOut` will help clear out a cookie to prevent the viewer from having a persistent log-in state. We'll have the `"Log Out"` item in the dropdown trigger the `LogOut` mutation when clicked to set us up for the next module.

In the `<MenuItems />` component, we'll import the `LOG_OUT` mutation document and the autogenerated interface for the data to be returned from the mutation. We'll also import the `useMutation` Hook.

At the top of the `<MenuItems />` component function, we'll use the `useMutation` Hook and simply return the `logOut` mutation request function only.

```tsx
// ...
import { useMutation } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import { LOG_OUT } from "../../../../lib/graphql/mutations";
import { LogOut as LogOutData } from "../../../../lib/graphql/mutations/LogOut/__generated__/LogOut";
// ...

export const MenuItems = ({ viewer }: Props) => {
  const [logOut] = useMutation<LogOutData>(LOG_OUT);
  // ...
};
```

In the `subMenuLogin` element, we'll wrap the contents of the "Log out" item with a `div` element that when clicked will trigger a component `handleLogOut()` function that will subsequently call the `logOut` mutation function.

Additionally, when the "Profile" item in the `<SubMenu />` element is clicked, we'll use the `<Link />` component from React Router to help navigate the `viewer` to the `user` page with the `id` of the `viewer`.

```tsx
// ...
import { useMutation } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import { LOG_OUT } from "../../../../lib/graphql/mutations";
import { LogOut as LogOutData } from "../../../../lib/graphql/mutations/LogOut/__generated__/LogOut";
// ...

export const MenuItems = ({ viewer }: Props) => {
  const [logOut] = useMutation<LogOutData>(LOG_OUT);

  const handleLogOut = () => {
    logOut();
  };

  const subMenuLogin =
    viewer.id && viewer.avatar ? (
      <SubMenu title={<Avatar src={viewer.avatar} />}>
        <Item key={`/user/${viewer.id}`}>
          <Link to={`/user/${viewer.id}`}>
            <Icon type="user" />
            Profile
          </Link>
        </Item>
        <Item key="/logout">
          <div onClick={handleLogOut}>
            <Icon type="logout" />
            Log out
          </div>
        </Item>
      </SubMenu>
    ) : (
      <Item>
        <Link to="/login">
          <Button type="primary">Sign In</Button>
        </Link>
      </Item>
    );

  return (
    // ...
  );
};
```

When the `logOut` mutation is successful, we'll want to notify the user it was successful and set the `viewer` client state object to a value that references a signed off viewer. To update the `viewer` state value in the parent `<App />` component, we'll need access to the `setViewer()` function available from the parent `<App />`.

In the `<App />` component, we'll pass the `setViewer()` function as a prop down to `<AppHeader />`.

```tsx
<AppHeader viewer={viewer} setViewer={setViewer} />
```

In the `<AppHeader />` component, we'll declare the `setViewer` prop and pass it along to the `<MenuItems />` component. This will complete what we intended to do for `<AppHeader />` component which will have the `<AppHeader />` component file look like the following:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { Layout } from "antd";
import { Viewer } from "../../lib/types";
import { MenuItems } from "./components";

import logo from "./assets/tinyhouse-logo.png";

interface Props {
  viewer: Viewer;
  setViewer: (viewer: Viewer) => void;
}

const { Header } = Layout;

export const AppHeader = ({ viewer, setViewer }: Props) => {
  return (
    <Header className="app-header">
      <div className="app-header__logo-search-section">
        <div className="app-header__logo">
          <Link to="/">
            <img src={logo} alt="App logo" />
          </Link>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="app-header__menu-section">
        <MenuItems viewer={viewer} setViewer={setViewer} />
      </div>
    </Header>
  );
};
```

In the `<MenuItems />` component, we'll declare the `setViewer()` function as an expected prop as well.

```tsx
// ...

interface Props {
  viewer: Viewer;
  setViewer: (viewer: Viewer) => void;
}

export const MenuItems = ({ viewer, setViewer }: Props) => {
  // ...
};
```

When the `logOut` mutation is successful, it'll return an empty `viewer` object (with a `didRequest` field set to `true`) as part of data. We'll use the `useMutation` `onCompleted()` callback and run the `setViewer()` function to set the `viewer` state value to the new received logged out `viewer` object.

```tsx
export const MenuItems = ({ viewer, setViewer }: Props) => {
  const [logOut] = useMutation<LogOutData>(LOG_OUT, {
    onCompleted: data => {
      if (data && data.logOut) {
        setViewer(data.logOut);
      }
    }
  });
};
```

We'll also look to display a success notification to tell the user they were able to sign off successfully. We'll import the `displaySuccessNotification()` function we have in the `src/lib/utils/index.ts` file and run it after the `setViewer()` function is used in the `onCompleted()` callback.

```tsx
// ...
import { displaySuccessNotification } from "../../../../lib/utils";
// ...

export const MenuItems = ({ viewer, setViewer }: Props) => {
  const [logOut] = useMutation<LogOutData>(LOG_OUT, {
    onCompleted: data => {
      if (data && data.logOut) {
        setViewer(data.logOut);
        displaySuccessNotification("You've successfully logged out!");
      }
    }
  });
};
```

If the `logOut` mutation was to ever fail, we'll want to notify the user. When the mutation fails, we'll want to run the `displayErrorMessage()` function we have in our `lib/utils/index.ts` file to show an error alert. Since we want to simply run a function, we can do so in the `onError()` callback of the `useMutation` Hooks which is a callback function React Apollo provides that runs when the mutation has _failed_.

With all the intended changes made to the `<MenuItems />` component, the `<MenuItems />` component file will look like the following:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";
import { useMutation } from "@apollo/react-hooks";
import { Avatar, Button, Icon, Menu } from "antd";
import { LOG_OUT } from "../../../../lib/graphql/mutations";
import { LogOut as LogOutData } from "../../../../lib/graphql/mutations/LogOut/__generated__/LogOut";
import { displaySuccessNotification, displayErrorMessage } from "../../../../lib/utils";
import { Viewer } from "../../../../lib/types";

interface Props {
  viewer: Viewer;
  setViewer: (viewer: Viewer) => void;
}

const { Item, SubMenu } = Menu;

export const MenuItems = ({ viewer, setViewer }: Props) => {
  const [logOut] = useMutation<LogOutData>(LOG_OUT, {
    onCompleted: data => {
      if (data && data.logOut) {
        setViewer(data.logOut);
        displaySuccessNotification("You've successfully logged out!");
      }
    },
    onError: () => {
      displayErrorMessage(
        "Sorry! We weren't able to log you out. Please try again later!"
      );
    }
  });

  const handleLogOut = () => {
    logOut();
  };

  const subMenuLogin =
    viewer.id && viewer.avatar ? (
      <SubMenu title={<Avatar src={viewer.avatar} />}>
        <Item key="/user">
          <Link to={`/user/${viewer.id}`}>
            <Icon type="user" />
            Profile
          </Link>
        </Item>
        <Item key="/logout">
          <div onClick={handleLogOut}>
            <Icon type="logout" />
            Log out
          </div>
        </Item>
      </SubMenu>
    ) : (
      <Item>
        <Link to="/login">
          <Button type="primary">Sign In</Button>
        </Link>
      </Item>
    );

  return (
    <Menu mode="horizontal" selectable={false} className="menu">
      <Item key="/host">
        <Link to="/host">
          <Icon type="home" />
          Host
        </Link>
      </Item>
      {subMenuLogin}
    </Menu>
  );
};
```

This should help us achieve what we set out to do! If we take a look at our app, sign in, then click the log out button - we'll notice that the viewer state has been removed! Great!

![](public/assets/app-header-logged-off-with-notification.png)

There are two important notes to make here before we close the lesson.

1.  The `logOut` graphQL mutation at this moment doesn't achieve anything significant. It simply returns an empty `viewer` object which we could have done on the client-side instead.

2.  Though we're able to effectively log-in as a user with the Google Sign-In flow, there's still a large flaw in our application. If we were to ever refresh our app when logged in, **our login state in the client is gone**. This isn't user-friendly since a user will have to sign-in to our application every time they refresh the page or close and open the browser tab/window.

This is going to be part of the investigation we'll make in the next module of the course by seeing how a viewer can maintain a _persistent_ login state in our application.
