# Module 4 Introduction

**OAuth** is an industry-standard protocol that enables applications to gain limited access to user accounts that have been created on different platforms. If you've ever signed in to an application with your Google account, Facebook account, Twitter account, etc. - that sign-in process was most likely made capable with OAuth!

In this module, we'll:

-   Explain what OAuth 2.0 is.
-   Create OAuth Credentials for [Google Sign-In](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in).
-   Update our GraphQL API to allow a user to sign-in with a Google account.
-   Construct the UI of the Login page of our client project.
-   Execute the `login` and `logout` mutations we'll create from the client.
-   Build the app header to convey to our user when in the logged-in state.
